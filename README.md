### End-to-End Automated NLP Tagging and Semantic Search System

In Misgrid, I designed and implemented a fully automated end-to-end system for intelligent tagging and semantic filtering powered by NLP.

Users can input natural language queries like:  
**"I'm looking for an ML engineer with Python and C++"**  
— and the system intelligently extracts relevant filters (e.g., roles, tools) using a custom language model.

The pipeline goes beyond static filtering:
1. **Dynamic Label Expansion**: When users add new professions or tools during profile creation, a validation model automatically verifies whether the new label is meaningful (e.g., accepts “C++”, rejects “flower”).
2. **Smart Query Mapping**: In the search interface, user queries are matched to existing filters using **cosine similarity** on embedded representations — enabling fuzzy, context-aware retrieval even for non-exact matches.
3. **Self-Updating Taxonomy**: The system evolves with usage, seamlessly integrating valid new labels while maintaining control over data integrity.

This forms a closed-loop system where **label creation, validation, search, and semantic matching are all fully automated**, creating a robust and scalable foundation for intelligent user discovery and collaboration.
